# TimeConverter-v1
You can find the time of any city in the world with respect to the time of your city, or the city whose time you already know.

Basically it needs only three inputs:

1) Name of your city or any city whose time you already know

2) Time of that city

3) Name of the city whose time you need to find

This tool uses Google Places API ( https://developers.google.com/places/ ) for all the conversions.
